# Web Scope Agent Notes

Scope: `apps/web/`

## Rules
- Touch only files in `apps/web/` unless explicitly instructed.
- Keep this app lightweight and focused on backend integration testing.
- Do not couple to mobile app internals.

## Validation
- Run `npm --prefix apps/web run build` after meaningful changes.
